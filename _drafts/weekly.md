##### [How China’s grave-sweeping festival is adapting to covid-19 - Economist](https://www.economist.com/china/2020/04/03/how-chinas-grave-sweeping-festival-is-adapting-to-covid-19):

> Wa Heaven was launched in 2009 to provide a digital means of paying homage to deceased family members. […]
> But with many such places closed to visitors because of covid-19, officials are encouraging the use of online options. Wa Heaven is busier than ever. “Last year we had around 30 people registering a day, this year it is thousands every day,” says Jia Yongqing, the portal’s founder.

It’a actually WaHeaven.com, which then directs you to http://www.5201000.com. 网站是QQ空间的风格，里面包括在线讣告，在线追思，还有推荐名人馆之类，可以通过虚拟货币祭拜。看起来非常超现实。文中提到的代扫墓服务其实一直都有，但今年肯定肯定尤其多。文中还提到香港政府做了个[官方app](https://www.memorial.gov.hk/Default.aspx?lang=1)，风格比waheaven稍微自然一些。[新华网报道](http://www.xinhuanet.com/fortune/2020-04/05/c_1125816900.htm)清明节首日各地网络祭扫平台服务群众1336万人次，但各地开放现场祭扫服务的殡葬服务机构（设施）共7729个，接待祭扫群众约572万人次。线上是线下的两倍。好奇新华网如何统计的。

It’s an excerpt from the diary of a 8-year-old, about COVID19.

##### [From bartering to begging for relief, struggling Americans confront April rent - Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-rent/from-bartering-to-begging-for-relief-struggling-americans-confront-april-rent-idUSKBN21I34J):

> Alfa Cristina Morales, 21, lost her job as a line cook at an Oakland, California, coffee shop, along with her health insurance, three weeks ago.
>
> Now she has been forced to take the money she had saved for a U.S. citizenship application and use it to pay bills, including her April rent. She is not sure how she and her 2-year-old son will make it through May. She has applied for unemployment benefits, which could take weeks to arrive.

美国号称橄榄球型社会，也就是说中层阶级人多。但低收入的人和月光族依然太多，而恰恰是这个人群的容错率最低：一旦出现意外生活立马崩溃。
