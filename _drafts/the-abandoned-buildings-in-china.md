In China, it is uncommon for people to buy apartments that are still under construction (or has not even started construction at all). This is due to the high demand and strong desire of people to own an apartment.

This unbelievable story is from Kunming. Apparently people bought apartments and started paying mortgage since 2012, and per contract apartments should be ready by 2015. However, the real estate company that manages the building ran out of cash due to aggressive expansion, haling the construction since 2014. These future residents kept waiting.

The problem is, many of them exhausted all of their money to afford this apartment. Again because of the strong desire of owning a place, in China it is common that people would go “all in” to buy real estate. Particularly after being hit by COVID19 in 2020, they couldn’t afford to pay rent and mortgage at the same time anymore. 30 of them gave up and started moving in to this unfinished building.

It is difficult to describe lives in such building: it is not painted, no window, no electricity or water, no basic appliances such as toilet or kitchen, and no elevator either. It’s basically a building of many caves.

People living there use portable battery to power lights in room and snatch water from adjacent river.
