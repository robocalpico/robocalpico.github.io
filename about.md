## About

<p class="noindent">
    Readhop keeps a record of what I have read at home page, and books I read at <code>Books</code> tab. I also write posts sometimes on various topics, which are in <code>Posts</code> tab. You can <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/feed.xml">subscribe through RSS feed</a>, the old school way.
