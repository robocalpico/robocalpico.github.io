Someone posts this article in WeChat: it’s filled with only one word 好 ("Good"):

One can treat this either as a silent protest or a joke on Chinese censorship. It is posted 2 days ago and still is alive. Would censorship take it down? Meanwhile, another similar post that came out a few days earlier was already taken down, and it looks like this:

It’s filled with one character "■". It went viral very quick, and was taken down after 4 days of existence. This is so surreal that I am not sure if such innovation against censorship has ever existed before. Some say it is to troll this great book called [平安经](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-hans/%E5%B9%B3%E5%AE%89%E7%BB%8F) ("book of peace"):

The book is filled with sentences of the same pattern, such as "xx平安", and doesn’t have any actual content. The interesting thing is [it’s written by a high-order CCP official](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/165030353), and its retail price is a whopping 299 RMB (for reference a typical book is about 20-80 RMB). Many organizations in the publishing and literature field praised and endorsed it before getting attention from the central gov. It has then been removed from shelves and the author [fired from his CCP post](https://news.sina.com.cn/c/2020-07-31/doc-iivhvpwx8550782.shtml). Like I said it is pretty surreal.
