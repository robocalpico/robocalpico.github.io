It has been over 2 months since last time of my format change, and I have some more thoughts. My initial purpose is just to document what I have read, and thoughts if any. Making them standalone posts deviates from that. Now it's more like I am writing essays for public reading. So the first thing is to get rid of weekly reading essay format; instead, I am gonna post just a list of articles I read each week, with some stats. Some would still come with my comments, but I will decrease their visibility so that they don't become the focus. Again, my primary motivation is to document my reading, not writing essays.

Now in addition to that change, I will still write essays. One cannot only consume without producing anything, so essays would be more like aggregated thoughts from me, consolidated and distilled from my reading. They can also be not from my reading too, as there isn't hard limit on that. Naturally essays would come a lot less frequent.

Finally, these changes would lead to UI changes too, so expect the site to look a bit different after the change - essentially breaking up the one list in home into 2 components: reading journal if you will, and the essays. Both components should have more stats too, to give visitors a direct view, and also serve the purpose of self documenting.

Thanks for reading.
